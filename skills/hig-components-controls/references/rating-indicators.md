# Rating indicators

A rating indicator uses a series of horizontally arranged graphical symbols — by default, stars — to communicate a ranking level.

![A stylized representation of a rating indicator denoting a ranking of three out of five stars. The image is tinted red to subtly reflect the red in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/aacce03e9d1c173b00080802bc79ff5d/components-rating-indicators-intro%402x.png)

A rating indicator doesn’t display partial symbols; it rounds the value to display complete symbols only. Within a rating indicator, symbols are always the same distance apart and don’t expand or shrink to fit the component’s width.

## [Best practices](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/rating-indicators#Best-practices)

**Make it easy to change rankings.** When presenting a list of ranked items, let people adjust the rank of individual items inline without navigating to a separate editing screen.

**If you replace the star with a custom symbol, make sure that its purpose is clear.** The star is a very recognizable ranking symbol, and people may not associate other symbols with a rating scale.
